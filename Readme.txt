OVERVIEW
--------
This game was built off of the first cutscene platformer. The multi-level format is dropped for a single large level with greater detail and a darkness mechanic. A new type of movement system was implemented to experiment with the idea of underwater movement. The objective is to get to the bottom of the level.
