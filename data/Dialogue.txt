CC: This place is friggin' dark, but at least I can move around a little easier down here.
I'll also be able to prime myself for a jump by holding the Z button.
So, this harpoon's actually some kind of grappling hook...
Good to know, but I don't think I'll need to use it again just yet.
It's weird... I'm swimming around in this goo...
But it's translucent, and not as thick as it usually is.
I'd almost say it's like water, but yet it isn't.

CC: ...Hey! The crayon's come off my suit!
I hope Phobia doesn't mind...

CC: This rumbling doesn't sound good...
#
CC: Nice view.
If I could actually see farther than five feet. Goddammit.
#
CC: ...The hell is up with these strands?
Oh well, gotta keep going.

CC: It's Slick's porthole! But how do I turn it off?
Porthole: SUIT 112 - MOLECULAR STRUCTURE CONFIRMED.
COMMENCING AUTO-SHUTDOWN. PREPARING M.M. UNIT FOR TRANSPORTATION.
CC: Well, that was, uh, easy.
Now I need to look for Phobia's sister.
I didn't see her on the way down, so she must be further ahead.
